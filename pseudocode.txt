Make a calculator:
It is going to have: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
It will be able to handle decimal numbers
It will accept multiple operations in a row eg. 12 + 7 - 5 * 3
It will accept to operate based on the answer, for example 5+2 = 7 +3 =10.
It will have a clear button
It will have a delete button
It will accept negative numbers
If you press an operator that you didn't want to you can change it pressing another operator, but you can't put two operators in a row.
It will only accept one dot
It will show the current operation in small above the result. the result in big

Example: 89*6 operation: when we write that at first the calculator has a 0.
Then you press 89 and the calculator shows 89 in big.
Then you press * and the calculator shows 89* in little above and 89 in big under.

Then you press 6 and above it shows 89* above and 6 under.

Finally you press = and it shows the result in big and 89*6= in small

Now if you press some operator instead of = it should return the result of the remaining operation in big and in small the result and the operator e.g. result +

Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!

Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”

Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!
