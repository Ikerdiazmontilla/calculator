Make a calculator:
It is going to have: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
It will be able to handle decimal numbers
It will accept multiple operations in a row eg. 12 + 7 - 5 * 3
It will accept to operate based on the answer, for example 5+2 = 7 +3 =10.
It will have a clear button
It will have a delete button
It will accept negative numbers
If you press an operator that you didn't want to you can change it pressing another operator, but you can't put two operators in a row.
It will only accept one dot
